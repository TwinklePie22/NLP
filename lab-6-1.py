# # Lab 6.1: Implementing Topic Modeling with Amazon Comprehend
# 
# In this lab, you will use Amazon Comprehend to extract topics from the [20 Newsgroups](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups) dataset.
# 
# ## About this dataset
# 
# The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. This collection has become a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering. In this lab, you will see what topics you can learn from this set of documents using the Neural Topic Model (NTM) algorithm.

# ## 1. Importing requirements and creating session variables
# ([Go to top](#Lab-6.1:-Implementing-Topic-Modeling-with-Amazon-Comprehend))
# 
# In this section, you will update and install the packages that you will use in the notebook. You will also create the session variables. 
# 

# In[1]:


import boto3
import uuid
# Client and session information
comprehend_client = boto3.client(service_name='comprehend')


# Constants for the S3 bucket and input data file
bucket = 'c137242a3503187l8671136t1w454410745650-labbucket-agijfcwjlndv'
data_access_role_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::454410745650:role/service-role/c137242a3503187l8671136t1w-ComprehendDataAccessRole-Tx08JBln003V'


# ## 2. Importing the newsgroup files
# ([Go to top](#Lab-6.1:-Implementing-Topic-Modeling-with-Amazon-Comprehend))
# 
# Now define the folder to hold the data. Then, clean up the folder, which might contain data from previous experiments.

# In[2]:


import os
import shutil

data_dir = '20_newsgroups'
if os.path.exists(data_dir):  # Clean up existing data folder
    shutil.rmtree(data_dir)


# The newsgroup documents are stored as individual files in a .tar file. 
# 
# In the next two cells, you unpack the dataset and extract a list of the files.

# In[3]:


get_ipython().system('tar -xzf ../s3/20_newsgroups.tar.gz')

print('Number of documents:', len(file_list))


# ## 3. Examining and preprocessing the data
# ([Go to top](#Lab-6.1:-Implementing-Topic-Modeling-with-Amazon-Comprehend))
#     
# In this section, you will examine the data and perform some standard natural language processing (NLP) data cleaning tasks.

# In[6]:


get_ipython().system('cat 20_newsgroups/comp.graphics/37917')


# Each newsgroup document can have the following sections:
# - header - Contains the standard newsgroup header information. This should be removed.
# - quoted text - Text from a previous message, which usually is prefixed with '>' or '|', and sometimes starts with *writes*, *wrote*, *said*, or *says*.
# - message - Body of the message that you want to extract topics from.
# - footer - Messages typically end with a signature.

# The following functions will remove the headers, quoted text, and footers.

    """
    Given text in "news" format, attempt to remove a signature block.

    As a rough heuristic, we assume that signatures are set apart by either
    a blank line or a line made of hyphens, and that it is the last such line
    in the file (disregarding blank lines at the end).

# ## 4. Analyzing the Amazon Comprehend Events output
# ([Go to top](#Lab-6.1:-Implementing-Topic-Modeling-with-Amazon-Comprehend))
# 
# 

# The compressed file that you downloaded from Amazon Comprehend contains two files:
# 
# - **topic-terms.csv** lists the topics in the collection. For each topic, the list includes the top 10 terms according to the weight.
# - **doc-topics.csv** lists the documents that are associated with a topic and the proportion of the document that is concerned with the topic. Documents can be listed for more than one topic.

# Load the topic-terms.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

# In[16]:


import pandas as pd
dftopicterms = pd.read_csv("topic-terms.csv")


# Review the first few rows.

# In[17]:


dftopicterms.head()


# Print each of the topics and the top words for each topic. 

# In[18]:


# Selecting rows based on condition
for t in range(0,number_of_topics):
    rslt_df = dftopicterms.loc[dftopicterms['topic'] == t]
    topic_list = rslt_df['term'].values.tolist()
    print(f'Topic {t:2} - {topic_list}')


# Note that the topics are not named. This is an exercise for a human to determine. 
# 
# Based on the words in the output for the previous cell, think of a word that describes each topic. In the following cell, replace the placeholder text with the words you have decided on to describe each topic.

# In[19]:


colnames = pd.DataFrame({'topics':['topic 0', 'topic 1', 'topic 2', 'topic 3', 'topic 4', 'topic 5', 'topic 6','topic 7','topic 8','topic 9',
       'topic 10', 'topic 11', 'topic 12', 'topic 13', 'topic 14', 'topic 15', 'topic 16','topic 17','topic 18','topic 19']})


# Next, read in the doc-topics.csv file.

# In[20]:


dfdoctopics = pd.read_csv("doc-topics.csv")
dfdoctopics.head()


# To make visualizations easier, select five articles to plot.

# In[21]:


to_chart = dfdoctopics.loc[dfdoctopics['docname'].isin(['newsgroups:1000','newsgroups:2000','newsgroups:3000','newsgroups:4000','newsgroups:5000'])]


# Next, use the `pivot_table` function to map the values in the **docname** column to actual columns. This will make it easier to create a chart.

# In[22]:


to_chart = to_chart.pivot_table(values='proportion', index='topic', columns='docname')
to_chart.head()


# Finally, plot the topics that belong to your newsgroup documents.
# 
# You will see that some documents have a single topic, while others contain a mixture. If you have too many topics, you can try to change the number of topics to get better results.

# In[23]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

fs = 12
# df.index = colnames['topic']
to_chart.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(16,4), fontsize=fs)
plt.ylabel('Topic assignment', fontsize=fs+2)
plt.xlabel('Topic ID', fontsize=fs+2)
